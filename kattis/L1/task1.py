 If we implement a simply greedy alg. here we can do it by: 
 (let S be the set of all intervals [a_i, b_i] and [A,B] is the set we want to cover)
 start with the set that starts at (or before) A and cover the most ground. 

 We first sort the smallest a then the second priority is the biggest b if they have the same a (or the biggest abs(a-b))

""" 
1) we sort the intervals 
2) The Greedy alg. 

1) this step uses sort() which uses the Timsort alg and is O(nlogn)

2) 
We have an outer loop that continues until the current is equal or larger than (to) B.

Then we have an inner loop:
i starts at 0 and increases, it's never reset thus we get max number of iterationsof inner loop to be nn. 
Thus the inner loop is O(n)

we get O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn)
