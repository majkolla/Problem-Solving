"""
We can solve this problem using a dp approach. 
We define a dp[i][j] = "maximum value using the first i items with the capacity j"
So we have rows i that correspond to considering items up to the ith item
And cols j corresponding to the capacity
   

dp[i][j]=maximum possible value using items from 1â€¦i
So we fill the table using this: 
dp[i][j] = max (dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-w_i] + v_i) assuming that w_i \leq j

after we fill out the table we do backtracking to find the the items 

the idea: 
- begin at (n,C) where n = #items and C = capasity
- if dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] we know that item i was not chosen 
- if dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-w_i] + v_i we know that item i was chosen 
- redo until (i or j) = 0
