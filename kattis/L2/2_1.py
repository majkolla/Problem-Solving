We have a a list of adjacencies that contains paris for each outgoing edge, then we use dijkastra with min heap (the heap q module)
so parent stores the pre that achieved the best distance, so we can rebuild the path. THen we got the normal pasrsing. 

Let  n = # vertices 
     m = # directed edges 
     
each vertex is popped once => n heappops 
every edge can maximum triggerf one improvement => m heappush 
heap1 operations costs log n  https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html

thus we get O((n+m)log n)
